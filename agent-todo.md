# Harness Todo

## v0.4.0

### Risks

- shipped `uvu` intentionally diverges from upstream callable returned suite
  objects because current AssemblyScript cannot model a callable object with
  attached methods cleanly; closing that gap would require a transform or some
  broader source-rewrite policy.
- shipped `uvu` callbacks still use shared `TestContext` rather than upstream
  crumb/context objects, so strict source parity remains incomplete even though
  the sync declaration slice now ships.
- guest-provided orchestration metadata can easily blur into guest-owned
  scheduling if the ABI grows new scheduler entrypoints instead of staying on
  discovery metadata plus host-owned `start()`.

### Adapter: `uvu`

- keep the shipped sync `uvu` builder surface stable:
  `test(...)`, top-level `test.before.each(...)` / `test.after.each(...)`,
  `suite(...)`, suite-builder `.test(...)`, `.only(...)`, `.skip(...)`,
  `.before(...)`, `.after(...)`, `.beforeEach(...)`, `.afterEach(...)`,
  `.run()`, and `exec(...)`.
- freeze the current builder-object divergence as the permanent `uvu` contract
  unless the repo later adopts a transform-backed rewrite policy.
- keep crumb/context callback parity and async behavior deferred until the
  higher-level compatibility decision is settled.
- keep upstream `Assertion` object parity deferred until the repo ships an
  adapter-local error-object contract.
