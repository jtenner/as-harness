# Harness Todo

## v0.6.0

### Risks

- shipped `uvu` intentionally diverges from upstream callable returned suite
  objects because current AssemblyScript cannot model a callable object with
  attached methods cleanly; closing that gap would require a transform or some
  broader source-rewrite policy.
- shipped `uvu` callbacks still use shared `TestContext` rather than upstream
  crumb/context objects, so strict source parity remains incomplete even though
  the sync declaration slice now ships.

### Adapter: `uvu`

- keep the shipped sync `uvu` builder surface stable:
  `test(...)`, top-level `test.before.each(...)` / `test.after.each(...)`,
  `suite(...)`, suite-builder `.test(...)`, `.only(...)`, `.skip(...)`,
  `.before(...)`, `.after(...)`, `.beforeEach(...)`, `.afterEach(...)`,
  `.run()`, and `exec(...)`.
- decide whether strict upstream callable-suite compatibility is worth a
  transform-backed rewrite layer or whether the current builder-object
  divergence should be frozen as the permanent contract.
- keep richer `uvu/assert` helpers, crumb/context callback parity, and async
  behavior deferred until that higher-level compatibility decision is settled.
